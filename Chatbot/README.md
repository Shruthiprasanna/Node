I got the user interface for the web from Pat Wilken(ref Prof Richard Hildred).

A chatbot written in es6 and vs6 for twilio and testing on the web. The important files are index.js and game.js.

A popular guessing game with numbers. You will make a choice by giving your answers(YES/NO) and the game in the end will guess your answers and use it in a sentence.

This game was designed for an assignment requirement for Mobile applications development class. It may not guess 100% right, as it was designed to amuse my son's geographical knowledge.
