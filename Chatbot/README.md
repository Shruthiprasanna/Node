-------------------------------------------------------
This game was designed for an assignment requirement for Mobile applications development class. 

I got the user interface for the web from Pat Wilken(reference from Prof Richard Hildred).

A chatbot written in Node.js and JavaScript. The important files are index.js and game.js.

A popular guessing game with numbers. Upon running the game,You will have to make a choice by giving answers(YES/NO) and the game in the end will guess your answers and use it in a sentence.It may not guess 100% right, as it was designed to amuse my 5 year old's geographical knowledge.
